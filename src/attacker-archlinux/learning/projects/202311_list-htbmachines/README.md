## Description

The code in the file is a shell script that provides a command-line interface for interacting with a set of machine properties stored in a JavaScript bundle file (bundle.js). It allows the user to perform various operations such as searching for machines by name or IP, updating the bundle file, getting YouTube video links for machines, and listing machines based on difficulty, operating system, or skill level. The script uses command-line arguments to determine which operation to perform and calls the corresponding functions accordingly.

## Usage

```bash
bash htbmachines.sh [operation] [arguments]
```
