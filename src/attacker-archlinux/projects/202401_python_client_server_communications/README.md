# Python Client-Server Communications Project

This project consists of two main files: `server.py` and `client.py`.

They establish a simple communication between a server and a client, in which the client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with another message one by one.

## server.py

This is a Python file that sets up a server.

The server listens for incoming connections from clients, processes their requests, and sends back responses.

It uses the ¿  module from Python's standard library to handle the low-level network communication.

## client.py

This is a Python file that sets up a client.

The client connects to the server, sends requests, and receives responses.

It also uses the ¿  module from Python's standard library to handle the network communication.

To run the server, use the following command:

## Usage

Run the server first by

```bash
python server.py
```

Then start the client

```bash
python client .py
```
